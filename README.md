# Reinforcement Learning Project

## About 

#### In this repo you can see the reinforcement learning and epsilon - greedy approach for maximizing the reward in a game including 15 players. We used the environment of python and the implementation is provided in "code.py". You can see all the expreriments, conclusions, as well as a theoritical reference for the algorithm in the "report.pdf"

## Epsilon - Greedy Algorithm

#### The Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm makes use of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by instructing the computer to:
- explore (i.e. choose a random option) with probability epsilon
- exploit (i.e. choose the option which so far seems to be the best) the remainder of the time
#### This combination, using the proper parameters for each problem, provides good results in the learning procedure.
